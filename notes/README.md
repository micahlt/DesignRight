All right, looking good!  However, I switched out the black with a dark, dark gray.  One rule of good design is to never use completely saturated colors.  Also, that phone image from UnDraw (on the Sign In and Sign Up pages) I replaced to match the new colors.  I also made your header image transparent (for the new dark gray background). I changed the color of the Why Use DesignRight section.  Next time you're on, I need you to move the images (newheader.png and profiles.svg) to the img folder (I can't, I'm on mobile) and change their `src` values to match.  I also put some stuff in ideas.md, so give me any opinions on that stuff.  See ya!
