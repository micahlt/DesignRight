Hey, man.  I completed the landing page.  I really like the landing graphic and it's free to use.  I think we should use its colors to theme the website.  I need you to finish styling the join and sign in forms and that's about all.  I'm going to update my Composr project so that we can use it to render the actual pages (profiles, ect.) 

Cya!

Okay, yes. That is a good background! I might just try and get rid of the text underlines as that ruins it but good colour scheme! I did last night imagine a different one about letting your passion shine with a sun, but we'll see... I just noticed that lots of the css for the landing page is not contributing to the page :/ btw, I personally think we should change the designs to our own ones and they look too lifelike (not the icons)! I'm gonna work on them now (^_^) ps you can call me geo :D
